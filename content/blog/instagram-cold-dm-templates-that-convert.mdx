faqs:
  - question: "What are the best Instagram cold DM templates?"
    answer: "The best cold DM templates follow the value-first structure: (1) Specific observation or question, (2) Offer valuable resource or insight, (3) Low-pressure ask. Templates should be personalized using an instagram dm tool like SocialOra, which uses AI to generate unique variations while maintaining your core message."
  - question: "How do I personalize cold DM templates?"
    answer: "Use dynamic fields like {{'{firstname}'}}, {{'{location}'}}, {{'{recent_post}'}} to personalize at scale. An instagram dm tool like SocialOra automatically inserts these details based on recipient data, ensuring each message feels personal even when automated."
  - question: "What's the ideal length for Instagram cold DMs?"

  - question: "How many cold DMs should I send per day?"
    answer: "Start with 20-30 cold DMs/day for new accounts, gradually increasing to 50-100 DMs/day for established accounts. Never exceed 10 DMs per hour. Use an instagram dm tool with built-in rate limiting like SocialOra to stay safe."
  - question: "Can I automate cold DM templates?"
    answer: "Yes! Instagram dm automation tools like SocialOra help you personalize cold DM templates at scale, schedule sends at optimal times, and follow up automatically. The key is using automation to enhance personalization, not replace it."
