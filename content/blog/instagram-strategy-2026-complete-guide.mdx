<FAQSection 
  faqs={[
    {
      question: "What's the most important Instagram strategy for 2026?",
      answer: "The most important strategy is building genuine community through authentic engagement. While content quality matters, the algorithm and users increasingly reward accounts that foster real connections, respond to comments, engage in DMs, and build relationships. Combine this with consistent, valuable content and strategic use of video (especially Reels) for maximum impact."
    },
    {
      question: "How much should I post on Instagram in 2026?",
      answer: "Aim for 3-5 Reels per week, 3-4 feed posts per week, and daily Stories. However, consistency and quality matter more than frequency. It's better to post high-quality content 3 times per week consistently than daily with mediocre content. Find a sustainable schedule that maintains quality and stick to it."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it worth investing in Instagram ads in 2026?",
      answer: "Yes, if used strategically. Instagram ads can accelerate growth, especially when promoting high-performing organic content. Start with small budgets ($5-10/day) to test what works, then scale winners. Focus on Reels ads and Story ads for best engagement. However, organic growth should remain your foundation - ads complement, not replace, good organic strategy."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I stay ahead of Instagram algorithm changes?",
      answer: "Focus on fundamentals that never change: creating valuable content, engaging authentically, building community, and providing genuine value. While algorithms change, these principles remain constant. Additionally, test new features early, stay informed through official sources, adapt quickly to changes, and don't try to game the system - focus on serving your audience well."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the best way to monetize Instagram in 2026?",
      answer: "Diversify your revenue streams. Don't rely on one method. Combine Instagram Shopping (if selling products), affiliate marketing, sponsored content, digital products, services, and subscriptions. The most successful creators have 3-5 revenue streams. Start with what aligns with your audience and expertise, then expand strategically."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I use AI for Instagram content creation?",
      answer: "Yes, but thoughtfully. AI can help with captions, hashtag research, content ideas, and editing. However, always add your personal touch, maintain authentic voice, and never fully automate creative decisions. Use AI to enhance efficiency while preserving authenticity. The best approach: AI for workflow, human for creativity and connection."
    },
    {
      question: "How important is video content in 2026?",
      answer: "Extremely important. Video, especially Reels, gets prioritized by the algorithm and sees highest engagement. Aim for 50% of your content to be video (Reels). However, don't abandon photos - carousel posts and single images still perform well. The key is variety: video for reach, photos for brand aesthetic and deeper content."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the biggest mistake to avoid in 2026?",
      answer: "The biggest mistake is focusing on follower count over engagement and business results. Vanity metrics don't pay bills. Instead, focus on building engaged community, providing value, and converting followers into customers. A smaller, highly engaged audience that buys from you is far more valuable than a large passive following. Measure what matters: engagement rate, conversions, revenue."
