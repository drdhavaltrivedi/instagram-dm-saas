# How to Find the Right People to Message on Instagram: Complete Targeting Guide

      
      Finding the right people to message is the foundation of successful Instagram outreach. Message the wrong people, and you'll get ignored or blocked. Message the right people, and you'll get 15-25% reply rates.

      This guide shows you exactly how to find the right people to message on Instagram, using both manual techniques and automated tools. This is part of our comprehensive guide on [how to do Instagram outreach that actually gets replies](/blog/how-to-do-instagram-outreach-that-actually-gets-replies).

      ## Why Targeting Matters for Instagram Outreach

      Poor targeting is the #1 reason outreach fails:

      

        - **Low Reply Rates:** Wrong audience = ignored messages

        - **Wasted Time:** Researching and messaging people who don't need your solution

        - **Account Risk:** Messaging random people can trigger spam flags

        - **Poor Conversions:** Even if they reply, wrong audience won't convert

      

      Good targeting, on the other hand, leads to:

      

        - 15-25% reply rates (vs. 2% industry average)

        - Higher quality conversations

        - Better conversion rates

        - Stronger relationships

      

      ## Define Your Ideal Prospect Profile

      Before finding people, clearly define who you want to reach:

      ### Demographics

      

        - Age range

        - Location (city, country, region)

        - Gender (if relevant)

        - Language

      

      ### Psychographics

      

        - Interests and hobbies

        - Pain points and challenges

        - Goals and aspirations

        - Values and beliefs

      

      ### Behavioral Indicators

      

        - Hashtags they use

        - Accounts they follow

        - Content they engage with

        - Posts they create

      

      ## Manual Methods: How to Find Prospects Manually

      Hashtags are goldmines for finding prospects:

      #### Step-by-Step Process

      

        - Identify 10-20 relevant hashtags in your niche

        - Search each hashtag on Instagram

        - Filter by "Recent" to find active users

        - Review profiles that match your criteria

        - Save prospects to a list or spreadsheet

      

      #### Hashtag Types to Target

      

        - **Industry Hashtags:** #marketing, #entrepreneurship, #fitness
