    {
      question: "How much money do I need to start an Instagram business?",
      answer: "You can start with $0-$100. Instagram is free to use, and you only need a smartphone. Initial costs might include: product inventory (if selling physical products), content creation tools ($0-$50), and a link-in-bio tool ($0-$10/month). Many successful businesses start with minimal investment and reinvest profits to grow."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to make money on Instagram?",
      answer: "Most businesses start seeing revenue within 3-6 months with consistent effort. The timeline depends on your business model, niche, content quality, and engagement strategy. Some see sales within weeks, while building a sustainable income might take 6-12 months. Focus on building trust and providing value before expecting significant revenue."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need a website to sell on Instagram?",
      answer: "Not necessarily. Instagram Shopping allows direct selling without a website. You can also use link-in-bio tools to collect payments through platforms like PayPal, Stripe, or Gumroad. However, having a website adds credibility and provides more control over the customer experience. Start without one if budget is tight, then add later."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the best niche for Instagram business in 2025?",
      answer: "The best niche combines your expertise, passion, and market demand. Profitable niches include: health and wellness, sustainable products, digital education, personal finance, pet products, and handmade goods. Choose something you're knowledgeable about and can create content for consistently. Research competition and audience size before committing."
    },
    {
      question: "How many followers do I need to make money?",
      answer: "You can start monetizing with as few as 1,000 engaged followers through affiliate marketing, digital products, or services. For sponsored content, most brands look for 5,000-10,000+ followers. However, engagement rate matters more than follower count. A smaller, highly engaged audience often generates more revenue than a large, passive following."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I use a personal or business account?",
      answer: "Use a business account for access to insights, shopping features, contact buttons, and advertising capabilities. Business accounts provide essential tools for growth and monetization. The only downside is you can't use trending audio in some regions, but the benefits far outweigh this limitation."
    },
    {
      question: "How often should I post to grow my business?",
      answer: "Aim for 3-5 Reels per week and 3-4 feed posts per week, plus daily Stories. Consistency matters more than frequency. It's better to post high-quality content 3 times per week consistently than daily with poor quality. Find a sustainable schedule that maintains content quality and stick to it."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I run an Instagram business without showing my face?",
      answer: "Yes! Many successful businesses don't show faces: product photography, graphic design content, pet accounts, quote pages, art and illustration, and educational content using voiceovers. However, showing your face often builds trust faster and creates stronger connections with your audience."
