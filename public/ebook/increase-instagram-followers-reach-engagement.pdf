This is a placeholder PDF file. In production, this would be the actual PDF eBook content.

For now, you can create the actual PDF using:
1. A PDF generation tool
2. Export from Google Docs/Word
3. A service like Canva or Adobe InDesign

The content should match the blog post structure and include all the sections mentioned.
